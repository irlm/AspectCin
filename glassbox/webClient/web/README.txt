Thank you for Downloading Glassbox 2.0

* Glassbox is a web application (a .war file) that should be deployed to your application server just like any other .war file.  
For example, on Tomcat you would place the glassbox.war file in <TOMCAT>/webapps directory and re-start Tomcat.

* Glassbox installation is automated within our webapp.  Once you deploy our webapp,  then go to http://SERVER:PORT/glassbox 
for our automated installer.  For example, on a Tomcat running on your localhost you might point your browser to:  http://localhost:8080/glassbox

* If you insist on installing Glassbox manually, go to the automatic installation page listed above and select manual installation. 
It will extract relevant jar files and provide suggested environment variable settings for you to edit an installation script.  
The installation page provides assistance and helpful instructions so we'd recommend you use it rather than just opening the .war file and pulling out libraries.

* For detailed installation instructions or questions about usage, look at the Glassbox 2.0 Beta User Guide. 
  The most up-to-date version can be downloaded at www.glassbox.com, but try this direct link first: http://www.glassbox.com/glassbox/Download.do?mediaItemId=173

* Glassbox forums are at http://www.glassbox.com/forum/forum/listforums (or reachable easily from the front page of glassbox.com)

* For instructions on BUILDING GLASSBOX yourself as opposed to using our pre-built glassbox.war file, please download the source from Glassbox.com or by connecting to our CVS in sourceforge.
  Instructions for building Glassbox are in the build project at /build/README-building.txt
