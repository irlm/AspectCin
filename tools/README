  What is it?
  -----------

  The tools package is a collection of libraries that are used
  by all modules. This set of libraries is needed when OpenORB
  shall be built from the sources.


  Build
  -----

  The tools module must be at the same level as all the other
  modules.

    CURRENT_DIR
      ./OpenORB
      ./NotificationService
      ./tools
      ...

  In order to build one of the modules, e.g. OpenORB just change
  into the OpenORB folder and call ./build.sh or ./build.bat.
  From this location the build scipts assume that the tools module
  can be found in "../tools".

  Note: The standard build setup assumes that the Java Runtime 
  Libraries are located in ${java.home}/lib/rt.jar. If your JDK doesn't
  use this path then you must specify the jdk-runtime-library property
  in the local.properties file.

  The Latest Version
  ------------------

  Details of the latest version can be found on the SourceForge
  Project web site <http://openorb.sf.net/>.


  Documentation
  -------------

  Folder etc:
     checkstyle.properties The properties file that is used by the
     module's build.xml checkstyle target. The properties are the
     same for all modules.

  Folder docbook:
     docbook-xml (entities), docbook-xsl for PDF/HTML generation.
     These docbook tools are used by the module's build.xml
     doc target.

  Folder lib:
     Common librariess without version information in the name.
     E.g. xerces_J_1.4.4.jar -> xerces.jar
