Provides extensions to the standard Avalon Logging framework.
</P>
<P>
The most notable extension is the provision on logging teams where by a 
main logger can have supplementary logger attached to it.
This is intially intended to provide access to special purpose diagnostics
loggers which will allow for fine grain control of information dumps without
the need for the static Trace class.
