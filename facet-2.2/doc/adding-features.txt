Adding Features to FACET
------------------------

To add a feature to FACET, follow these steps:

1.  Create a directory under $FACET_ROOT/src/edu/wustl/doc/facet for
    the feature.  The directory name that you choose will be part of
    the package name for your feature.

2.  Create a public interface for the feature with an embedded aspect
    to register the feature with the Feature Registry.  See any of the
    other features for how to do this. Ensure that you register it in
    the correct manner based on what type it is - Abstract, Mutex etc.

3.  Write the aspects, classes, and unit tests that are part of your
    feature.

    All introductions which should show up in the IDL of the
    EventChannel must be done in a file with a name ending with
    'IntroAspect.java'

4.  Add a "use_<your featurename here>=t" to the facet.properties and
    facet_template files.

5.  From the $FACET_ROOT directory, do this :
         
    $ ant clean
    $ ant feature.deps

    This ensures that dependency information for the new set of
    features is generated (this happens only from the top-level ant
    build).

    If all goes well, FACET shall get built with the latest feature
    set.  If you see an error about the featuredeps.xml file being
    malformed or something similar, restore the old version of the
    featuredeps.xml file from CVS.
