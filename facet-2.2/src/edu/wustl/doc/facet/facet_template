## Copy this file to facet.properties and uncomment the features that you
## would like to enable.

## To disable compiling and testing all unit tests, uncomment the following
## line or add it to the platform.properties file.

## The general format for enabling a feature in package X is to set:
## use_X=t
##
## Below is a shortened list of features that can be uncommented to be
## included.  If the feature depends on another feature, that other
## feature will be automatically included by the build files.

## - Feature 'ConsumerDispatch'
## 
## Provides simple filtering based on type

#use_feature_consumer_dispatch=t

## - Feature 'CorrelationFilter' 
##
## Allows logical correlation event filtering using AND, OR etc

#use_feature_correlation_filter=t

## - Feature 'EventAny' 
##
## Pushes CORBA Any as the event data (OMG Spec)
## [push (Any)]. Available only with CORBA enabled
##
## Note that the other possibility is having Event structs -
## EventStruct - which most features require and automatically pull in.

#use_feature_event_any=t

## - Feature 'EventObject' 
##
## Pushes java.lang.Object as the event data 
## Available only with CORBA disabled
## [push (Object)]

#use_feature_event_object=t

## - Feature 'EventPull' 
##
## Enables the Event Pull interfaces

#use_feature_event_pull=t

## - Feature 'EventBodyString' 
##
## Makes the event payload a string

#use_feature_eventbody_string=t

## - Feature 'EventBodyAny' 
##
## Makes the event payload a CORBA Any

#use_feature_eventbody_any=t

## - Feature 'EventBodyObject' 
##
## Makes the event payload a java.lang.Object

#use_feature_eventbody_object=t

## - Feature 'EventBodyOctetSeq' 
##
## Makes the event payload an Octet sequence - which maps to byte []
## in Java

#use_feature_eventbody_octetseq=t

## - Feature 'EventType' 
##
## Enables the type field on the Event header

#use_feature_eventtype=t

## - Feature 'EventVector' 
##
## Enables support for pushing a vector (or sequence) of Events

#use_feature_eventvector=t

## - Feature 'RealtimeDispatcher' 
##
## Support for real-time dispatching of events using RT Java
##
## Ensure that you edit $FACET_ROOT/jvm-wrapper to use the Timesys JVM

#use_feature_realtime_dispatcher=t


## - Feature 'RtecCorrelationFilter' 
##
## Support for emulation of the TAO RTEC Correlation Filter's
## semantics. OR, AND etc are n-ary operators etc.

#use_feature_rtec_correlation_filter=t

## - Feature 'SourceFilter' 
##
## Support for source filtering

#use_feature_source_filter=t

## - Feature 'SupplierDispatch' 
##
## Support for supplier based disptching based on type

#use_feature_supplier_dispatch=t

## - Feature 'TimeStamp' 
##
## Enables timestamping of event as they are received by the event
## channel.

#use_feature_timestamp=t

## - Feature 'Tracing' 
##
## Support for tracing method execution in the event channel. Very
## useful for debugging.

#use_feature_tracing=t

## - Feature 'Ttl' 
##
## Support for the Time to Live (TTL) field in federated event
## channels. 

#use_feature_ttl=t


## Feature 'ThroughputTest'
##
## Used for throughput test measurements

#use_feature_throughput_test=t

#
# Only one of the following features must be enabled 
#

## Feature 'DisableCorba'
##
## Do not use CORBA as the transport layer
## This feature makes the Event Channel a simple Java application

use_feature_disable_corba=t

## Feature 'EnableCorba'
##
## Use CORBA as the transport layer

#use_feature_enable_corba=t
